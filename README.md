# Blood Cells Classification 

An attempt to build and train a model able to perform a classification on blood cells. The study conducted here is practical. Studied aspects of convolutional neural networks are detailed in the section "The Study". 

# The Data 

Original data can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells. Data are images of 4 different types of blood cells : NEUTROPHIL, MONOCYTE, EOSINOPHILE, LYMPHOCYTE. There frequencies distribution as well as their aspect are shown on the two following figures.
